      Each child excitedly waits for summer vacation. My summer vacation will begin one week from now. The delight of not going to class for the following couple of days is happiness inside me. I have arranged a beneficial summer vacation for me this year. I have wanted to get up late in the morning. The bliss of finding each day like Sunday is the best part of this long excursion.I have intended to join the Music class on summer vacation. I have also wanted to make a daily schedule of regular cycling during the whole summer break. One of my favourite cousins’ elder sibling guaranteed me to visit me. I am truly so pumped up for my summer vacation.

      Traveling is usually a fun and a great experience for many people. What I plan on doing later in life is to travel to many different cities so I can experience many different city cultures and history. If people want to take a trip, whether it be somewhere in the United States, or maybe even another country, it is very important to have a plan, not only to where you would like to go, but money wise, because every country have different currencies so it is very important that if you are planning to travel to another country to know the different currency for each country before you make your trip. The first and very important tip for planning your vacation is that, you have to know where exactly you would like to travel to. It is also very important to be specific.

      If you are plan on traveling by bus or train, or even by car, I’d still recommend you pack the night before so that in the morning, or the day that you plan to leave, you could just leave, and another tip I’d recommend is that, if you are driving by car with family, I’d recommend that you bring snacks for everyone to munch on for the long trip, and maybe even a movie but only for the people in the back seat.
